# Description
A console based app to read basic Windows and CCM logs. It may support .evtx but its currently untested.
The script/exe supports string and type filtering, as well as live tailing. 

# To Do:
Support and test .evtx formats.
Add a script to the repo that automatically adds the .exe to PATH to make running it easier from the terminal.

# Note
This was created with sizeable amount of AI help. I'm not a software developer just an IT person that felt CMTrace.exe was a little slow with 
larger log files >100,00 lines. That's why this is wrote mostly in PowerShell as its what I know best. I did have the AI help me speed it up with 
some C# functions.
